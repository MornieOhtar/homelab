# About project
Homelab-argocd project is generally to be used for automatic management of current HomeLab installation via ArgoCD.

Main approach for this project is creating stable, as-automatic-as-possible deployment of Homelab to kubernetes cluster, 
that should properly backup to on-site and off-site storage with support for easy recovery.
